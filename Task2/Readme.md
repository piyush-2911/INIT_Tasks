# Task2

## Datasets Used:
- Unsupervised Learning on Country Data
- source: kaggle
- Description: Socio-economic and development indicators for different countries.
- Type: Unsupervised learning dataset

- Heart Disease Dataset
- source: kaggle
- Description: Contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., used to predict the presence of heart disease.
- Type: Supervised learning dataset

## Problem Statement:
- Goal for the Unsupervised data set is to find countries which are in the direst need of aid by using different socio-economic and health factors.(Clustering problem)

- Goal for the heart disease dataset is to predict the target.(Classification Problem)

## Summary:
The notebook performs:
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- K-Means clustering and elbow method
